## Reflection

This was a 6 month long project built during my eight semester at Balkumari College (Tribhuvan University). Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to create and book homestays. I started this process by using the `create vite@latest` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` and `contextAPI`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, ContextAPI and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create vite@latest` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
